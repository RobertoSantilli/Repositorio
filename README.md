Hello, welcome to my portfolio, where I show a small sample of my knowledge of Test Automation with Cypress 🛠️🖥️✔️📑

In this repository, you will find the Excel file called "PushingIT - RTM," where you can find the different scenarios and test cases that were considered in this repository. Additionally, you can find a bug report that was found during the test execution.

The tests are performed on the Pushing IT page, which is useful for anyone interested in QA to perform practical exercises.

⚠️Important note⚠️: The Pushing IT page takes a while to load the first time you try to register or log in, so please wait a minute or two for the page to activate and complete all the exercises.
